# Face-Recognition-System
Face recognition is a method of identifying or verifying the identity of an individual using their face. 
There are various algorithms that can do face recognition but their accuracy might vary.
Here I had used openCV .OpenCV uses a face detector algorithm called a Haar Cascade classifier.
